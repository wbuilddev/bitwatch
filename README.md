## Files

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `index.html` | HTML structure and layout |
| `styles.css` | All styling |
| `app.js` | Application logic and API integrations |
| `.htaccess` | WordPress compatibility |

## Deployment

Upload all files to any web server — no Node.js, no build step required.

### Running from root

Place `index.html`, `styles.css`, `app.js`, and `.htaccess` in your web server's root directory. Access the app at `yourdomain.com/`.

No changes to the code are needed — the file references in `index.html` are relative (`styles.css` and `app.js`), so they load from whatever directory `index.html` is in.

### Running from a subfolder

Place all files in a subfolder, for example `/bitcoin-bitwatch/`. Access the app at `yourdomain.com/bitcoin-bitwatch/`.

This also works without any code changes — the relative file references automatically resolve to the correct subfolder path.

## Data Storage

All data is stored in the browser's localStorage — nothing is sent to any server. Your data stays on your device.

- `bitwatch_addresses` — Monitored Bitcoin addresses
- `bitwatch_alerts` — Transaction alerts (max 25)
- `bitwatch_settings` — User preferences

## Security

- **Watch-only** — No private keys, read-only address monitoring only
- **Local data** — All data stored in browser localStorage
- **No backend required** — All API calls made directly from the browser
- **No tracking** — No analytics, no cookies, no third-party scripts
